These namelists were used to run FESOM2 on the so3 mesh from 1950-1956 using initial codnitions taken from 31-12-1949 from FESOM2 simulations on the mr mesh described in the model/runscripts/mr-1851/ directory of this repository. Forcing data is taken from the AWI-CM-1-1-MR r1i1p1f1 historical simualtion in CMIP6.

The model was initialized with a timestep of 36 seconds and run for two months. Afterwards, a timestep of 144 seconds was used.
